# UI
### Overview
This directory houses Cnchi's UI code. Cnchi is designed to support a pluggable UI. What that means is that its possible to use other toolkits/frameworks for the UI without having to make major modifications to the rest of the codebase. Currently, the HTML/Javascript UI is the focus of all active development as it is the default.
