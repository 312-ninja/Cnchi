# TODO: Add all catalyst (amd/ati) supported cards Â¿?
# TODO: User should be able to choose between radeon and catalyst
# TODO : One should disable kernel mode setting for this driver
# TODO: Packages are from AUR. They should be added to Antergos repo, shouldn't they?

# From https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AMD_Catalyst :
# Owners of ATI/AMD video cards have a choice between AMD's proprietary driver (catalyst)
# and the open source driver (xf86-video-ati). This article covers the proprietary driver.
# AMD's Linux driver package catalyst was previously named fglrx (FireGL and Radeon X).
# Only the package name has changed, while the kernel module retains its original fglrx.ko filename.
# Therefore, any mention of fglrx below is specifically in reference to the kernel module, not the package.
# Catalyst packages are no longer offered in the official repositories.
# In the past, Catalyst has been dropped from official Arch support because of dissatisfaction with the quality
# and speed of development. After a brief return they were dropped again in April 2013 and they have not returned since.
# Compared to the open source driver, Catalyst performs worse in 2D graphics, but has a better support for 3D rendering
# and power management. Supported devices are ATI/AMD Radeon video cards with chipset R600 and newer
# (Radeon HD 2xxx and newer). See the Xorg decoder ring or this table, to translate model names (X1900, HD4850)
# to/from chip names (R580, RV770 respectively) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_AMD_graphics_processing_units)
