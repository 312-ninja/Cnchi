### ENLIGHTENMENT TODO LIST

 - Enable connman in process.py
 - Set Antergos wallpaper
 - Add music player
 - Check that .config directory is not owned by root (test again)
 - Set GTK Theme : gtk-theme-e17gtk (or some dark variation of numix)
 - Set Numix Icons
 - Change GTK Font (from Cantarell 11 to Sans 10, for instance)
 - Change Terminology font (default one is too small!)

More to come...
