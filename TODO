TODO (1st gen 2013)

* General:
 - Check all file paths
 - Logging (it's a mess. It also creates log file with root privileges, is it ok?)

* Language screen:
 - Seems ok.

* Installer_ask screen:
 - Seems ok.

* Installer_automatic screen:
 - More testing is needed

* Installer_easy screen:
 - Seems ok.

* Installer_advanced screen:
 - If you play with the partitioner (create partition, delete it, create it
   again, delete it again...) in the end it gets confused.

* Timezone screen:
 - Add NTP switch?
 - Modify the locale at the /install directory where partitions with the new
   system are mounted

* Keyboard screen:
 - Doesn't sort words that have accents (arcnexus fixed it, needs testing)

* User screen:
 - Seems ok.

* Slide screen:
 - Should hide close/exit button

Also in installer_thread:
 - Real installation happens here. Getting info from /arch/setup
