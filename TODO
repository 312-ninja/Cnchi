TODO (1st gen 2013)

* General:
 - Check all file paths

* Language screen:
 - Seems ok.

* Installer_ask screen:
 - Seems ok.

* Installer_automatic screen:
 - More testing is needed

* Installer_easy screen:
 - Should create/adapt installation script to accept root and swap
   partitions as a parameter

* Installer_advanced screen:
 - Extracted from Ubiquity. Still far from being finished.
 - Use pyparted to create/delete our partitions.
 - Must store the label of "staged" partitions to be created
   somehow in the class, probably as a dict object.  It was crashing because it
   was trying to get label of partition that didn't physically exist.  I fixed
   it to error to showing no label, but we should display the label the user
   had entered.  

* Timezone screen:
 - Add NTP switch?
 - Modify the locale at the /install directory where partitions with the new
   system are mounted

* Keyboard screen:
 - Doesn't sort words that have accents

* User screen:
 - Seems ok.

* Slide/Installation screen:
 - Installation process run over pyalpm
 - Should hide close/exit button
