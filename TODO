CNCHI TODO LIST (4th October 2013)

* General:
 - Check if we can remove subprocess calls to pythonian code
 - Encrypt home directory (done, needs testing)

* Advanced Install:
 - If you play with the partitioner (create partition, delete it, create it
   again, delete it again...) in the end it gets confused.
 - Add LVM support (create / delete)

* Timezone screen:
 - Add NTP switch

* Alongside install:
 - Rethink this option. Doesn't work as it is.

* Automatic install:
 - Encrypt whole partition in automatic install

FUTURE:
* EFI support
