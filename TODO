CNCHI TODO LIST (7th March 2014)

* General:
 - Check if we can remove subprocess calls to pythonian code
 - Encrypt home directory (done, needs testing)

* Advanced Install:
 - If you play with the partitioner (create partition, delete it, create it
   again, delete it again...) in the end it gets confused.
 - Add LVM support (create / delete)

* Slides screen:
 - Redo some slides
 - Remove popup (install completed) and add a message inside the slides screen.

* Alongside install:
 - Rethink and redo this option. Doesn't work as it is.
 
And much more... (see issues in github)
