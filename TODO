CNCHI TODO LIST (11 Mar 2013)

* General:
 - Check all file paths (os.path.join)

* Installer_advanced screen:
 - If you play with the partitioner (create partition, delete it, create it
   again, delete it again...) in the end it gets confused.

* Timezone screen:
 - Add NTP switch
 - Modify the locale at the /install directory where partitions with the new
   system are mounted 

* Keyboard screen:
 - Doesn't sort words that have accents (arcnexus fixed it, needs testing)

* Slide screen:
 - Not all the installer events (messages) show correctly. pac.py generates
   too many messages

* installer-thread.py file:
 - create_fstab needs testing.
